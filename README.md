## Synopsis

Pyhton Battery Saver Pack is completly dedicated to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries. This is very accidental. It helps to improve battry life almost 1.5 Times. :)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

It is based on the Article provided by Battery University:
http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries

Thanks to Dr. HS Rai for showing us path to this unique Idea and believing in us throughout the whole process.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Future Goals

This version is only for x86-32 and x86-64 bit architecture (Mostly All INTEL and AMD processors) but we believe every device which keeps battery for Main or backup power must have this application.
